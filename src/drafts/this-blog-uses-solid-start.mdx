description: How to set up a blog using solid-start and mdx.
---

This website uses [solid-start](https://start.solidjs.com/getting-started/what-is-solidstart).

solid-start is a Next.js-like framework for creating SSR / SSG websites. But instead of react, it builds on top of solid-js.

I've been using solid and solid-start professionally for almost 2 years. And while solid-js feels rock-solid, solid-start still feels rough around the edges.


For each of the features I wanted to implement, I ran into issues that delayed this from being a weekend project into taking about 4 weekends instead.

Here's what I wanted to accomplish:
1. Use [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) for writing the posts
2. Define metadata for each post in the same mdx file
3. Full SSG
4. Code highlighting at compile time
5. Tags

And here's how I did it:

## Using mdx

MDX is markdown that you can intersprinkle with jsx.

The initial scaffolding is easy, follow [these steps](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/getting-started), and choose the `with-mdx` option.

I opted to have my posts live under the `/blog` path.
